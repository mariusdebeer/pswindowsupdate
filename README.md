# PS Windows Update
As the name suggests, this will install the PSWindowsUpdate module in Powershell, allowing you a bit more control over Windows Update, removing updates, etc.
It also gives you the ability to script your update schedule (and run via taskscheduler, for example).

This is just a collection of commands that work - so no magic here except it will save you some Google'ing to get it right.
